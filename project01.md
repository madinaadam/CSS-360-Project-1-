## 1: New e-Commerce site

> PerfectApparel wants to launch a new e-Commerce site to sell clothes, shoes, and accessories.
> - Customization features
> - The current in-house templates and an interpreter written in Java will be reused with minor changes
> - Your team has mixed experience levels and will coordinate with a seperate group developing the Java Interpretor

### Individual Selections

|**Name**          | **SDLC Choice** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| *Samantha Wang*  | An Agile SDLC is best because customer-facing features like customization and recommendations will evolve through feedback and experimentation; thus, needing the ability to iterate incremental changes.|
| *Madina Adam*  | Agile fits because the site needs frequent updates, new features, and flexibility to adapt to customer feedback while coordinating with another development team.|
| *Tristan Mejia*  | Integrate & Configure. Since PerfectApparel already has an extensive library of tools, which I am expected to use, it makes sense to choose this life cycle. I can analyze the requirements and specify the software modules to be developed, and then hand that off to the team that codes the interpreter. This method will also allow all the features, many of which are com to come together at the same time, so PerfectApparel will get their site fully complete.|
| *Prince Ovbiebo* | For the new PerfectApparel e-Commerce site, I would choose the Agile SDLC model. The project involves adding new features like customization tools and outfit matching, which are likely to change as the business learns what customers want. This allows the team to deliver core shopping functionality early while continuing to add and refine features over time, which works well with the existing template and scripting system.|
| *Emily Nguyen* | The requirements will likely change as new features like customization and matching outfits are tested with users. An incremental or agile model allows the team to release core features first and then add improvements over time while working with the separate interpreter team.|


### Group Selection

**SDLC:** Agile Model

**Justification:** Agile is a good fit because the e-Commerce site includes customer-facing features like customization, outfit matching, and recommendations that are likely to evolve based on user feedback. The project also involves reusing existing templates and coordinating with a separate team developing the Java interpreter, so Agile’s flexibility and iterative development help the team adapt to changes while delivering functional features early.

**Considerations:** We also considered the Incremental and Integrate & Configure models because the project builds on existing tools and could be delivered in parts. However, those models assume more stable requirements, while this project benefits from ongoing testing and refinement. Agile was the better choice because it supports both incremental delivery and continuous feedback.

**Key Aspects:** The main factors we considered were changing requirements and team coordination. Changing requirements make an iterative approach necessary, and coordination with another development team requires a flexible model that supports frequent communication and adjustments.

## 2: Dental office site

> Your friend wants to develop a website for their new dentistry clinic.
> - Needed now: hours, location, staff, forms
> - Flexible with project timespan
> - Future needs: online appointment scheduling, automated text reminders, issue of discounts, and continous updates to the site

### Individual Selection

|**Name**          | **SDLC Choice** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| *Samantha Wang*  | For the dental office site, I would choose an incremental SDLC model. The website initially only needs a basic deliverable with essential information. Since additional features will be added over time, incremental development allows the site to be expanded gradually after the initial setup is complete.|
| *Madina Adam*    | Incremental. Incremental works well since the site can be built and delivered in small parts, starting with basic content and expanding over time as new features are added.|
| *Tristan Mejia*  | Incremental Development. This dental office site includes several features, some of which are critical to the site's function, while others are less important. Using incremental development, I can focus on important features first and add the extras later. This also gives my friend the opportunity to ask for more features down the line.|
| *Prince Ovbiebo* | I would use the Incremental model here because the dentist is flexible with deadlines and wants to keep adding new features in the future, such as online appointments and automated reminders. It supports the kind of gradual growth needed and allows the site to improve over time without needing all requirements finalized upfront.|
| *Emily Nguyen*  | The website would be incremental. It can be built step by step, starting with basic pages like hours, location, and staff. New features such as online appointments and text reminders can be added later as the clinic grows. |

### Group Selection

**SDLC:** Incremental Model

**Justification:** This was a unanimous decision. The Incremental model provides fast initial output by delivering a basic but functional website early. As the dental clinic grows, additional features and continuous content updates can be added in later increments. This approach supports flexibility, ongoing improvement, and client feedback without requiring all requirements to be finalized upfront.

**Considerations:** We also considered the Waterfall odel due to its simplicity and clear structure. However, Waterfall assumes stable and fully defined requirements from the beginning, which does not align well with this project’s evolving feature set. Since the dentist anticipates ongoing updates and future functionality, the Incremental model is a better fit, allowing gradual expansion while minimizing rework and supporting long-term adaptability.

**Key Aspects:** The key aspects we looked at were flexibility and how few features are needed right now. The project doesn’t have a strict timeline, and our friend only wants a basic website to start with. Since more features will likely be added later, we wanted an SDLC that makes it easy to build on the site over time.

## 3: Nuclear Power Plant

> You are the PM for the development of a software system meant to monitor the status of a nuclear power plant
>- You will work with a group of knowledgeable scientists
>- Critical operations
>- Needs to deal with possibility of hardware failure (Needs sturdy safety nets)
>- Long lifespan (expected 10 years)
>- Able to subcontract out parts of the development

### Individual Selections

|**Name**          | **SDLC Choice** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| *Samantha Wang*  | For something so safety-critical, use of the V-Model would be best suited. It would ensure verification at every step and reduce room for error.|
| *Madina Adam*    | Spiral is appropriate due to the high-risk and safety-critical nature of the system, emphasizing continuous risk analysis, testing, and validation.|
| *Tristan Mejia*  | Waterfall Development. Because the software for a nuclear power plant is _safety critical,_ it makes sense to hash out exactly what it must do before developing any of it, to minimize the possibility of bugs or security holes slipping in as the project pivots. Because I have access to outside technical help (and the behavior of nuclear reactors is already understood and doesn't change,) defining this software's requirements beforehand should be feasible, and since it will run in place for decades, the extra flexibility of other techniques is not necessary. Plus, having a complete specification makes it much simpler and less risky to subcontract out some software work.|
| *Prince Ovbiebo* | I think the Waterfall model is the most appropriate choice. This is a safety-critical system where failures could have serious consequences, so having well-defined requirements and a structured development process is essential. I initially thought Incremental would be good but too much flexibility might actually be more dangerous.|
| *Emily Nguyen* | This system must be very safe and reliable. The Spiral model allows the team to check for risks and test carefully at each stage of development.|


### Group Selection

**SDLC:** V-Model

**Justification:** The V-Model is a good fit because this is a safety-critical system where failures could have serious consequences. It emphasizes testing and verification at every stage, which helps reduce risk and catch issues early. Since the system is expected to run for many years, having strong validation and documentation is important.

**Considerations:** We also considered Waterfall and Spiral. Waterfall works well for clearly defined requirements and subcontracting, but it lacks continuous validation. Spiral focuses heavily on risk analysis, but its flexibility adds complexity. The V-Model combines structure with continuous testing, making it the safest choice.

**Key Aspects:** The main factors we considered were safety and reliability. Safety was critical due to the high-risk nature of nuclear systems, and reliability was important because the software must operate correctly over a long lifespan.

## 4: Department of Transportation

> Your company is developing a distributed application (A distributed system is a computing environment in which various components are spread across multiple devices on a network) storing data on the cloud.
>- 100 pages of detailed specifications from the D.O.T.
>- You and your team have an abundance of experience in developing similar solutions prior
>- Conditions: 18 month deadline and only a team of 10 software engineers

### Individual Selections

|**Name**          | **SDLC Choice** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| *Samantha Wang*  |Since all of the specifications are detailed and clearly established, a Waterfall model would be best used for this context. The team’s proven experience and set schedule align well with a structured approach.|
| *Madina Adam*    | Waterfall is suitable because the project has fixed, detailed requirements and a clear timeline, making a structured, sequential approach effective.|
| *Tristan Mejia*  | Waterfall Development. I chose waterfall development mostly because the spec for the software is already done for us, so no need to waste time going through the project piece by piece. Plus, since the structure of this life cycle is so regimented, it's much easier to ensure that the deadlines can be met (and to set them in the first place.)|
| *Prince Ovbiebo* | I would choose the Waterfall model for the Department of Transportation project. The system requirements are already clearly defined in a detailed 100-page specification, and the company has prior experience building similar systems.|
| *Emily Nguyen* |The project has very detailed and stable requirements in a 100-page specification. Since the scope is clear and the team has experience, a structured Waterfall approach fits well.|


### Group Selection

**SDLC:** Waterfall Model

**Justification:** Waterfall is a good fit because the project has very detailed and fixed requirements provided by the Department of Transportation. The team has strong experience with similar systems, and the 18-month deadline benefits from a clear, structured development plan with well-defined phases.

**Considerations:** We also considered Iterative and Agile models because the system is distributed and cloud-based. However, since the specifications are already fully defined and unlikely to change, the flexibility of those models is not necessary. Waterfall allows the team to focus on execution rather than revisiting requirements.

**Key Aspects:** The main factors we considered were clear requirements and schedule constraints. Clear requirements make a sequential process effective, and the strict deadline favors a model that is easy to plan and manage.

## 5: Reducing Traffic

> Your company is building a distributed traffic system using GPS, sensors, cameras, and digital billboards.
>- Tracks individual cars and overall traffic conditions
>- Provides real-time updates to transportation officials and drivers
>- Team has strong C++ embedded systems experience
>- Large-scale, real-time, reliability-critical system

### Individual Selections

|**Name**          | **SDLC Choice** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| *Samantha Wang*  |Due to the amount of hardware involved, I think the Spiral method would be best suited for this case. It would iterate multiple times, catching faults or disconnects that would likely be common when working with mixed media, prior to completing a full-scale release.|
| *Madina Adam*    | Incremental development allows hardware and software components to be built, integrated, and tested step by step for reliability and performance.|
| *Tristan Mejia*  | Waterfall Development. I chose waterfall development again because this system is mostly embedded, meaning not much chance of requirements changing, doesn't involve a lot of standalone features that can be developed after-the-fact, and is, if not safety critical, at least critical to the function of the traffic systems it controls. Additionally, this kind of work is likely the one my team will do best with, given their qualifications.|
| *Prince Ovbiebo* | For the traffic reduction system, I would use the Incremental development model. This project involves integrating multiple technologies, including GPS devices, sensors, cameras, and real-time displays, which introduces technical risk.|
| *Emily Nguyen* |The system combines hardware, networking, and software, so building and testing in stages reduces integration risk. Each increment can be validated before moving on to the next component.|


### Group Selection

**SDLC:** Incremental Model

**Justification:** The Incremental model is a good fit because this system is large, complex, and includes many parts such as GPS devices, sensors, cameras, and real-time displays. Building and testing the system in stages allows the team to make sure each component works correctly and reliably before combining everything into the full system.

**Considerations:** We also thought about using the Spiral model because it focuses on finding risks and testing often. However, Incremental seemed better since it allows the team to slowly build and combine the hardware and software without making the process too complex.

**Key Aspects:** The key aspects we looked at when making our final SDLC decision were system complexity and reliability. Complexity matters because many different technologies must work together, and reliability is critical because the system provides real-time traffic information that affects public safety.



## 6: Educational game

> Your team is developing educational games with changing requirements and fast delivery needs.
>- Small team of 7 experienced game developers
>- Requirements evolve quickly
>- Customers need early versions for testing
>- Close communication with educators and stakeholders

### Individual Selections

|**Name**          | **SDLC Choice** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| *Samantha Wang*  |Since the requirements rapidly evolve and quick delivery is necessary, Agile Scrum would work best for this. Since the team is small, it wouldn't get overwhelming in terms of communication, and it would allow for the early testing needed.|
| *Madina Adam*    | Agile is ideal because requirements will change based on user feedback, requiring quick iterations and frequent testing.|
| *Tristan Mejia*  | Integrate and Configure. Plenty of software solutions already exist to make developing games simpler. For a large number of (probably technically simple) projects with ever-changing requirements, which must be delivered ASAP, saving time (and money) wherever possible is important. Integrate and configure is cheap, fast, hard to do wrong, and by far the easiest to correct on-the-fly.|
| *Prince Ovbiebo* | The Agile model is a good fit for the educational game project. The requirements are expected to change as teachers and students provide feedback, and the games need to be delivered quickly for testing. Agile supports rapid releases and ongoing improvements, which is ideal for game development.|
| *Emily Nguyen* | Game requirements will change based on teacher and student feedback. Agile allows rapid prototyping, frequent testing, and fast releases.|


### Group Selection

**SDLC:** Agile Model

**Justification:** Agile is the best fit because the project needs fast delivery and the requirements are expected to change often. For an educational game, feedback from teachers and students will directly shape development, and Agile supports quick iterations, rapid prototyping, and frequent testing to keep up with that feedback.

**Considerations:** We also considered the integrate and configure approach since many existing tools can speed up game development and reduce cost. This model is efficient and easy to adjust, especially for technically simple projects with tight timelines. However, Agile was chosen because it better supports continuous feedback and structured iteration throughout development.

**Key Aspects:** The most important aspects of Agile for this project are frequent testing, fast releases, and adaptability. These allow the team to respond quickly to user feedback, improve the games over time, and deliver playable versions early for evaluation.

## 7: Global Health

>Your startup is creating software to improve health outcomes in developing countries.
>- Team of 5 people total
>- 2–3 experienced developers at the start
>- More hiring needed during development
>- Funding depends on demonstrated real-world impact

### Individual Selections

|**Name**          | **SDLC Choice** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| *Samantha Wang*  |Agile would be best for this scenario due to the limited team size. It would have the ability to complete the quick releases needed for funding.|
| *Madina Adam*    | Agile supports a small startup team by enabling rapid releases, evolving requirements, and early demonstrations of impact.|
| *Tristan Mejia*  | Incremental Development. This software benefits from being able to function while still in-progress, since if the software can be deployed, at least in part, early, it can benefit the communities it is supposed to and hopefully earn more grants. Plus, it gives me opportunities to rework the software to function better if necessary to meet that goal. With a core team that I have a personal relationship with, formal coordination isn't as important, so a regimented structure is not as beneficial.|
| *Prince Ovbiebo* | For the global health software project, I would also choose the Agile model. The startup has a small team and evolving goals, especially since future funding depends on demonstrating impact.|
| *Emily Nguyen* |The team is small and still growing, and funding depends on showing impact quickly. An Agile approach allows fast development, experimentation, and adjustment based on real-world results.|


### Group Selection

**SDLC:** Agile Model

**Justification:** Agile makes the most sense here because the team is small and the goals are still evolving. It supports quick releases, which are important for showing impact early and helping secure funding. Agile also allows the project to adapt as new needs come up, which is likely in a global health context.

**Considerations:** We also considered the Incremental model since it allows the software to be usable while it is still being developed. That approach would help deliver value to communities early and allow room for improvement over time. However, Agile felt like a better fit because it offers more flexibility and supports changing requirements more naturally.

**Key Aspects:** The key aspects we considered before picking Agile for this project were rapid iteration, early releases, and adaptability. These Agile features make it easier to respond to feedback, improve the software continuously, and align progress with funding and impact goals.
