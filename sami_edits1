### 2: Dental office site

|**Name**          | **SDLC Choice** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| *Samantha Wang*  | For the dental office site, I would choose an incremental SDLC model. The website initially only needs a basic deliverable with essential information. Since additional features will be added over time, incremental development allows the site to be expanded gradually after the initial setup is complete. |
