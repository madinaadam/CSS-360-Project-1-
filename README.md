Report

Individual Section

#Summary

The goal of this exercise is to work in groups to discuss issues and select an appropriate software development lifecycle (SDLC) model for each of the following seven projects. Consider yourselves as being the program/project manager for each project development team. Being in the shoes of the PM, you will need to justify the decision to the team.  
Each individual in the group will select their choice for the SLDC model and justify it for each project independently. Then, the whole team as a group will need to come to a consensus/decision on the model for each project, and justify their selection.
Additionally, we will get practice using source control (GitHub) to work on a shared project and Markdown to format written text.

##Report
---
##Individual Section
Each team member should individually make a choice for the SDLC for each project.   
This choice should be made individually before discussing the projects with the overall team.  
The report should contain each team member's answer and a brief justification (2-3 sentences), for each project.  
(i.e. If you have 5 team members, there should be 5 people x 7 projects = 35 total answers and justifications).

Consider how to use markdown features to organize and display this information in a neat manner.  (e.g. tables, lists, headers, separate pages are all options here).

##Group Section
After everyone has made their individual selections, the group should come together and make a final team decision on the SDLC for each project.  
For each project, your group should have the following information.
- The final team’s answer/SDLC choice
- Thorough justification for why this model was selected for this project (i.e., What makes it a good fit? How can this SDLC help with developing this project?)
- 1-2 other models that were considered, and why the final selection won out over them.  
- The 1-2 key aspects of the project that were most important to your final SDLC decision.  Explain why these aspects are critical to this decision.

Projects
For each of the following project proposals, choose a lifecycle model and justify your decision.  

#1: New e-Commerce site
PerfectApparel wants to launch a new e-Commerce site to sell clothes, shoes, and accessories. 
The company wants to provide an online shopping experience that will attract customers to come back to the site. 
For example, customers may select their own colors, create their customized design, and quickly find matching outfits. 
Today, PerfectApparel mainly uses in-house templates with its own custom scripting and extensions to create web sites. 
An interpreter written in Java reads the templates and scripting and generates the appropriate web page based on a customer’s request. 
Your management expects you to use same tools with minor modifications to generate HTML5 pages and extensions needed for the new features. 
Your team consists of a combination of developers from your previous projects, new hires, and interns. 
You will need to define requirements for any template or scripting extensions that you want and schedule their development with a separate group that develops 
the Java interpreter and related software.

#2: Dental office site
Your good friend, a dentist, asks you to develop a web site for their new clinic. 
The web site should include common information about the clinic like hours, location, dental staff, and downloadable forms.  
At some point in the future, they would like to include an ability to make online appointments, send automated reminders via text messages, and issue discounts. 
Your friend is flexible with the time when you will deliver software.  They also wish to continually add capabilities to the website in order to draw more patients to their clinic.

#3: Nuclear Power Plant
You have been assigned to oversee the development of software that will monitor the status of a new nuclear power plant.  
You have a group of scientists who can provide you with domain knowledge to help you design the software.   
Because of news of previous power plant failures, e.g., Three Mile Island and the more recent Fukushima-1 event in Japan, you want to make sure that the software 
you are designing will be robust, is able to deal with hardware failure, and can fail safely.  The software is expected to last for a long time (at least 10 years). 
The utility company who owns the power plant allows you to subcontract parts of the software development, but you are ultimately responsible for the overall operation of the software. 

#4: Department of Transportation
Your company won the contract to develop a distributed application which stores data on the Cloud.  
This is in response to a thorough 100 page specifications from the Department of Transportation. The specifications is very detailed in what’s expected from the application. 
Your company has developed similar solutions in the transportation domain on numerous previous occasions, and you have the appropriate experienced staff for the project. 
You bid on the project to be completed within 18 months based on a team of 10 software engineers.

#5: Reducing Traffic
An experienced technology company hires you to manage a new project that incorporates distributed computing and networking with car tracking equipment. 
The equipment will be used to monitor individual cars (via GPS tracking devices) and general traffic (via sensors and cameras) in both surface streets and freeways.  
Transportation officials should also be able to provide real-time traffic updates on digital billboards along the roads.   
Your team has mainly created proprietary hardware/software solutions in the past. The team has substantially skills in using object-oriented C++ to develop embedded systems.

#6: Educational game
You lead a small experienced team of 7 developers from a gaming company. Your team is responsible for quickly developing educational games based on preliminary and evolving 
set of requirements.  You have internal and external customers who expect to use your games ASAP for their own testing efforts. 
You have a team member who participates on educational conferences as well as acts a marketing representative to your customers, the teachers and administrators at your 
local school district.

#7: Global Health
You and your friends won a multi-million dollar grant from a foundation to develop software to address current global challenges.  
Your startup company is also eligible to receive further grants if it can demonstrate significant positive impact on the health of the people residing in developing countries.  
Your whole company currently only has 5 people. You will need to hire team members as part of the development effort. 
Your starting team consists of 2-3 developers who you know very well from previous projects.

Markdown
Your entire report must be written in markdown language.  Your submission will be graded on its formatting and overall presentation (in its rendered form).
Your submission must feature at least 4 of the following markdown features.  The features must be used in a sensible way within the context of the report.  

Headers
Text formatting

GitHub
Your team must use a shared GitHub repository to develop your submission. 

Use a public GitHub repository and share the link in your submission.
Each student must have at least 4 commits.  
There is no minimum size for each commit (in fact, more and shorter commits are recommended)
Each commit must have a meaningful title and a brief description.

What to Turn In
A link to the GitHub project where your team developed the report.  You can include this link at the top of your report or add it in a comment on the assignment.
One or more .md files containing your report.
