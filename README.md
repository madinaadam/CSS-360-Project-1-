Report

Individual Section

Each team member should individually make a choice for the SDLC for each project.   
This choice should be made individually before discussing the projects with the overall team.  
The report should contain each team member's answer and a brief justification (2-3 sentences), for each project.  
(i.e. If you have 5 team members, there should be 5 people x 7 projects = 35 total answers and justifications).

Consider how to use markdown features to organize and display this information in a neat manner.  (e.g. tables, lists, headers, separate pages are all options here).
